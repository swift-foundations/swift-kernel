        ///
        /// ```swift
        /// var entries = [Kernel.IOCP.Entry](repeating: .init(), count: 64)
        /// let count = try Kernel.IOCP.dequeue(
        ///     port,
        ///     entries: &entries,
        ///     timeout: .milliseconds(100)
        /// )
        ///
        /// for i in 0..<count {
        ///     let entry = entries[i]
        ///     let key = entry.key
        ///     let bytesTransferred = entry.bytes.transferred
        ///     // Dispatch to handler based on key
        /// }
        /// ```
