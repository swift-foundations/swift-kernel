        ///
        /// ```swift
        /// let result = try Kernel.IOCP.read(handle, into: buffer, overlapped: &overlapped)
        /// switch result {
        /// case .pending:
        ///     // Wait for completion via IOCP
        ///     let entry = try Kernel.IOCP.Dequeue.single(port, timeout: INFINITE)
        ///     let bytesRead = entry.0
        /// case .completed(let bytes):
        ///     // Completed immediately, no IOCP notification
        ///     processData(buffer.prefix(Int(bytes)))
        /// }
        /// ```

            /// The operation is pending asynchronously.
            ///
            /// A completion packet will be posted to the IOCP when the
            /// operation finishes. Do not access the buffer until then.
