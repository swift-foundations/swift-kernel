    extension Kernel.IOCP {
        /// Tracks the state of an asynchronous I/O operation on Windows.
        ///
        /// Every asynchronous I/O operation requires an `OVERLAPPED` structure
        /// to track its state. The structure must remain valid until the
        /// operation completes. Common patterns embed this in a larger struct
        /// to associate application state with the operation.
        ///
        /// ## Usage
        ///
        /// ```swift
        /// var overlapped = Kernel.IOCP.Overlapped()
        /// overlapped.offset = filePosition
        ///
        /// // Start async read (overlapped must stay alive until completion)
        /// try Kernel.IOCP.read(
        ///     handle,
        ///     buffer: buffer,
        ///     overlapped: &overlapped
        /// )
        ///
        /// // Later, retrieve completion
        /// let entry = try Kernel.IOCP.dequeue(port, timeout: .infinite)
        /// let bytesRead = entry.bytes.transferred
        /// ```
        ///
        /// ## Container-Of Pattern
        ///
        /// For associating state with operations, embed `Overlapped` as the
        /// first field of a struct:
        ///
        /// ```swift
        /// struct MyOperation {
        ///     var overlapped: Kernel.IOCP.Overlapped
        ///     var buffer: [UInt8]
        ///     var callback: (Int) -> Void
        /// }
        /// ```
        ///
