        ///
        /// ```swift
        /// let result = try Kernel.IOCP.write(handle, from: buffer, overlapped: &overlapped)
        /// switch result {
        /// case .pending:
        ///     // Wait for completion via IOCP
        ///     let entry = try Kernel.IOCP.Dequeue.single(port, timeout: INFINITE)
        ///     let bytesWritten = entry.0
        /// case .completed(let bytes):
        ///     // Completed immediately, no IOCP notification
        ///     print("Wrote \(bytes) bytes synchronously")
        /// }
        /// ```
