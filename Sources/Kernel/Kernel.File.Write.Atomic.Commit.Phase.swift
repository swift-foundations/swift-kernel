    /// After catching an error, check the phase to understand the file state:
    /// ```swift
    /// do {
    ///     try atomicWrite(data, to: path)
    /// } catch {
    ///     if phase.published {
    ///         // File exists at destination, but durability may be compromised
    ///     } else {
    ///         // File was NOT written to destination
    ///     }
    /// }
    /// ```
